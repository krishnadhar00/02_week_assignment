    <h1>Comments</h1>
    <p>Comments are not displayed in the browsers. You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date. Whatever the text is written inside the comment those text are not displayed on the web browsers. You can also use comments to simplify your debugging efforts by "commenting out" lines of code without deleting them. Comments are enclosed in <!-- --> tags. These tags tell the browser that the text inside them is a comment and should not be rendered on the front end. With the comments tag, you can leave notes to remind yourself where you left off in the build process. You could explain the intended functionality of a section of code for another developer or your future self. Or, you might assign someone a task or point out an error for them with a comment. In short, commenting in HTML helps you work smarter when building or debugging a website. This tag is used for both single line as well as multi-line comment.</p>
